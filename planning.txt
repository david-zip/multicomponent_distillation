# Distillation Column Plan

Requires a Dictionary with all teh MW of each component that the class can easily extract the MW from. The dictionary should eventually be expanded to contain other physical and chemical properties (boiling point, density, etc.).

## Classes
- Distillation Column
- Feed
- Product/Distillate/Top
- Bottom

## Properties
**Distillation Column**
- Components
    - Composition
